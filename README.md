# Bouncing Balls

## Description

An application which has multiple shapes that move across the application's
window and bounce off the bounds of the window. Users can use a built-in GUI
to modify properties of each shape such as its visibility, scale, velocity,
colour, and name.

The application reads the data for the window settings, fonts properties, and
initial shape data from a text file.
